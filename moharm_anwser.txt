1-The program uses fork() to create a new process. After the fork, there are two processes:
the child process (pid = 0)
the parent process (pid > 0)
Each one prints its own PID. It shows how fork duplicates a process.

2-sleep 300 & runs the sleep command in the background.
jobs shows the background process that is running.

3-ps aux | grep sleep finds the PID of the sleep process.
kill <PID> stops (terminates) that process.

4-kill -STOP <PID> pauses the process.
kill -CONT <PID> resumes the process again.

5-The linker combines multiple C files into one program.
In the lab, it connects the hello() function in kassab1.c with the call to hello() in kassab2.c

6-The loader loads the program and its shared libraries into memory.
It prepares everything so the program can start running
